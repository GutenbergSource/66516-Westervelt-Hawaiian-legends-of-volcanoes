<HTML><BODY>Another collection of Hawaiian stories, this time related to Volcanoes, by the American author W.D. Westervelt.

<p>As usual with my projects, I've placed unnumbered plates at the end of the volume. Sometimes in the B&amp;W page-images, the text may be hard to read. The full-color plates are also in the project and may be easier to read. No further difficulties expected, so have fun!
